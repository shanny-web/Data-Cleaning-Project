ðŸ”´ Raw Data Issues

The raw dataset had the following problems:
	â€¢	Inconsistent ID formats (e.g., id-001, 001, ID001)
	â€¢	Irregular Name formatting (extra spaces, inconsistent capitalization, missing values)
	â€¢	Age column with mixed data types (numbers, strings like "Thirty", and missing values)
	â€¢	Email column with spaces, invalid addresses, and missing entries
	â€¢	Duplicate records
	â€¢	Unsorted Emulation Numbers

ðŸŸ¢ Cleaning Steps Performed
	1.	Standardized all IDs into a consistent format (ID-001, ID-002, â€¦).
	2.	Removed spaces and corrected capitalization in Names; replaced missing names with "Unknown".
	3.	Converted Age column to numeric values, handled errors, and replaced missing values with the median age.
	4.	Cleaned Emails by removing spaces and replacing missing emails with "not_provided@mail.com".
	5.	Removed duplicate records based on Email.
	6.	Sorted dataset by Emulation_No in ascending order.
